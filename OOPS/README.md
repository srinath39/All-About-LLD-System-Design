# 📘 What is OOPS?

## 📌 Introduction
**OOPS (Object-Oriented Programming System)** is a programming approach that helps developers write clean, reusable, and well-structured code by modeling real-world entities.

Instead of writing long procedural code, OOPS focuses on **objects** and **classes**.

## 🌍 Real-World Analogy

Think about a **Car** 🚗

A car has:
- **Properties** → color, model, speed  
- **Behaviors** → start(), stop(), accelerate()

In programming, we create a **class** (blueprint) for a car and then create multiple **objects** from it.

---

## 🧠 What is a Class?
A **class** is a blueprint that defines:
- What data an object will have
- What actions it can perform


---

## 👤 What is an Object?
An **object** is a real instance of a class.

Example:
- Car1 → Red BMW  
- Car2 → Blue Audi  

Both are created using the same `Car` class.

---

## 🔧 Why Do We Need OOPS?

Without OOPS:
- Code becomes difficult to manage
- Reusability is low
- Changes affect many parts of the program

With OOPS:
- Code is modular  
- Easy to reuse  
- Easy to maintain  
- Easy to scale

## 🔑 Core Concepts of OOPS

1. **Encapsulation** – Binding data and methods together  
2. **Abstraction** – Hiding unnecessary implementation details  
3. **Inheritance** – Reusing existing code  
4. **Polymorphism** – Same action, different behavior

## 📦 Example (Simple Understanding)

Consider a **Bank Account**:

- Properties: accountNumber, balance  
- Methods: deposit(), withdraw()

Each customer has a separate account object, but all follow the same structure.

---

## ✅ Advantages of OOPS
- Code reusability  
- Better security  
- Easy maintenance  
- Real-world modeling  
- Faster development

## 🧠 Summary

> **OOPS is a programming approach that models real-world objects to make software more organized, reusable, and easy to understand.**
